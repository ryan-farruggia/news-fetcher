make it so that new news entries are detected and marked with a span

so:

- an array currently stores all entries.
- have this array compared to a second array that will store new entries.
-if there are any new entries compared to the old array, mark only those entries
and only display the new ones on the page (append them to the top).
- animate the new ones in while keeping the old ones displayed
- that would be pretty epic i think

then just export it to an electron app and cross yo mf fingers!
