# how to run

1. run the `.exe` file
2. if you terminate the program using task manager, the server will still be running in the background, sad and lonely. You'll need to kill the server by terminating the task called "NodeJS runtime environment".
3. if you refresh the news too many times, it will not appear again for 1 hour to reduce strain on the API.
